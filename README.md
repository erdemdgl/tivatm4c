This repository contains a simple example of displaying text on an LCD using the Tiva TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller. The project is split into three main files:

\n-lcd.h The header file containing function prototypes and constants used by the LCD driver.
\n-lcd.c – The source file implementing LCD-related functions (initialization, data/command writing, etc.).
\n-main.c – The main application where the microcontroller is configured and the LCD functions are called.
